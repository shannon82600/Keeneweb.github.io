  <H2> About me </H2>
  <p> My name is Shannon Doyle, I am a sophmore at Keene State College. I was born in Beverly, Ma and spent most of my childhood in Peabody and Danvers, MA. As a kid I always had a natural bond with animals I am a Biology major and I live in holloway hall. In high shcool I attended a vocational school with specialized programs.
    I was enrolled in the vet science, so throughout high school I learned about animal science. Now that I am in college I hopefully want to focus on animal biology, more specificly maybe wildlife rehabilition.
  In the future i would like to work in the outdoors, I found that I don't work well in offices. I have many different employment experiences including: babysitting, tutor, a sub shop, walgreens, and now a finanical advising company.
  I believe that it is very important to have a lot of work experience in different areas.  </p>
